# ACT_Workflow_GIS_GameEngines

This github contains all the resources that are used in the workflow of how to use Kadaster data in game engines using Esri's ArcGIS Maps SDK for game engines. It is divided in to two parts, the unity part and the unreal engine part, depending on what engine you are using.

Note that the SDK itself is not included, follow the workflow to install this SDK seperately. More info can be found on: https://earlyadopter.esri.com/key/ArcGISforGameEngines

The workflows can be followed using this link: https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/58a27579b3f74c49938c199f5059360a
